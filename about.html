<h3>i Hi guys my name is Brandon. Iam 19 years old my birthday is on 29th May 2005 I was born in Trans-Nzoia county,Kenya. My father's name is Anderson Mwenesi. I am the second son after my elder brother
    Eugene  Maurice. I also have a younger sister named Charnelle Ungagi whom I adore. My mother's name is Emily Nasong'o who works at Kenya Airways. My father's job is at a company called Irrihub. I live
    in imara daima with my aunt Eunice Mbucothis is where I get information on how to code wheever Ihave questions. It has alot of information on various coding languages. There is also an area where we could also ask questionson any topic
    related to coding. I also practise typing on a site called Codewars. i realy like codinng and want to become a software engineer. Though it is very tiresome, it is rewardig to see what you have built 
    take shape. It takes alot of time to perfect the skill but it is also satisfying.</h3>
